# ImmutableQueue

In object-oriented and functional programming, an immutable object is an object whose state cannot be modified after it is created. This is in contrast to a mutable object which can be modified after it is created.

Classes should be immutable unless there's a very good reason to make them mutable. If a class cannot be made immutable, limit its mutability as much as possible. The JDK contains many immutable classes, including String, the boxed primitive classes, and BigInteger and etc. Basically the immutable classes are less prone to error.

This is a basic implementation of an immutable queue.
